# So the optimal model is GARCH(1,1)

# Since both additions of sigma_2 and gamma_2 turned out to be insignificant,
# the GARCH(1,1) model will also be preferable to the GARCH(2,2) model

#Let's check for volatilities of the GARCH(1,1) model
# Estimate the volatility

#Annualize the volatilities

# According to parameters estimation this model is better than the simple GARCH(1,1) model
# So, for now tGARCH(1,1) model shows better coefficients estimates (see Pr(>|t|) - all coefficients are significant)
# All our coefficients are significant at 1% level and the Akaike information criterion is better (lower)

#Create the EGARCH(1,1) model and check for lambda asymmetry coefficient
eGARCHspec11 <- ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = "eGARCH",

# asymmetry coefficient is represented by aplha1 which is < 0, but insignificant
# the negativeness says that positive shock has less effect, than the negative shocks.

#Finally, let's compare the models
M_garch11
t_garch11
e_garch11

#We will use AIC
# For GARCH(1,1)  : -5.2395
# For GRACH-t     : -5.3745
# For EGRACH(1,1) : -5.2481

# The smallest value for AIC is in GRACH-t, so we conclude that this model is the best one

# Now let's calculate the volatility for this model:
vol_t = t_garch11@fit$sigma

#Annualize the volatilities
vol_t_ann = vol_t*(250)^(1/2)*100

#Plot the graph of the volatilities
plot(vol_t_ann, type = "l", xlab = "")

# And forecast the volatilities for GARCH-t model
# Forecast the volatilities for T+1 and T+2 periods
# Forecast for 2 periods
volforec_t = ugarchforecast(e_garch11, r, n.ahead = 2)
volforec_t

# Convert the volatility to annual volatility
volt_ann_forec = volforec_t@forecast$sigmaFor*(250)^(1/2)*100
volt_ann_forec
#Still we have a high volatility for period T+1: 221.09% and period T+2: 200.81%
